# screenshots-and-examples
Screen shots and code samples from previous projects

A brief explanation of the file contents:

JPL folder:
 - 3 screenshots of different parts of the application
 - 2 JavaScript files that show a bit of code using React lifecycle methods and basic parent child relationship and usage of      Redux.
 
A2B folder
	- 2 Screenshots of different parts of the application
	- 3 Javascript files that show the rendering of a list of universities and the functionality to add a new university. These 		are using React Hooks and graphQL (query syntax to communicate with the backend).
		Parent component: Universities.js
		Child component: AddUniversities.js
		Grandchild component: UniversityInfoForm.js

The JPL file is part of the application I have written on my own entirely, including design, structure and code, before I started working with A2B. The A2B code is part of a larger project with 2 other developers and a developer/designer. My main responsibility is implementing new functionality integrating the front and back end and not the design side of it.
